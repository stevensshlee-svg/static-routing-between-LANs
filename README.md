# Static routing between LANs
Configuring Inter-LAN connectivity using static routing

## Overview
Built a two-router topology to demonstrate Layer 3 routing between separate LANs using manually configured static routes

## Networks
LAN A (Los Angeles): 192.168.10.0/24
LAN B (New York): 192.168.20.0/24
WAN Link: 10.0.0.0/30

## Key Tasks
* Configured DHCP on each router to provide end host connectivity within each LAN
* Configured router interfaces and WAN point-to-point link
* Created static routes to each LAN
* Validated packet flow using ping and tracert
